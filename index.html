					I'm the Principal Lead Software Engineer of the <a
						href="https://www.lsspcorporation.org/lincc/frameworks">LINCC Frameworks</a> team here at CMU.


					<br />
					<br />
					I'm excited to be on this team because I get to bring my arsenal of
					experience in high-performance machine learning infrastructure
					development to my old flame of astrophysics. See appendix for more details on these.
